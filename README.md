# Google Homepage Clone
 Practicing web technologies 
Date of Creation: September 2021

Background:

Just before programming this page I was taking part in a Web Development Bootcamp, and just finished my HTML/CSS sections. As a way to practice my newly acquired basic HTML/CSS knowledge, I thought about what websites could I try to replicate that would be good for a beginner, Google's homepage seemed like a good choice since it was quite basic. This was the first project that I started and completed, I thought I would upload it as a start to my programming journey.
