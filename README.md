# Google Homepage Clone
 Practicing web technologies 
Date of Creation: September 2021

Background:

Just before programming this page I was taking part in a Web Development Bootcamp, and just finished my HTML/CSS sections. As a way to practice my newly acquired basic HTML/CSS knowledge, I thought about what websites could I try to replicate that would be good for a beginner, Google's homepage seemed like a good choice since it was quite basic. This was the first project that I started and completed, I thought I would upload it as a start to my programming journey.

About The Project:

At the time of making this project, I made the links on the page identical to Google's. The links on the page will take you to offical Google pages. The search bar and the "google search" voice command buttons do not work.
